*A comprehensive guide to the architecture of the Checklist Generator application*

[.lead]
This document describes the architecture, components, and user flows of the Checklist Generator web application.

== Overview

[.lead]
The Checklist Generator is a React-based web application that allows users to create, manage, and share customizable checklists.

The application follows a component-based architecture with modern React patterns including hooks and functional components. This document outlines the key architectural decisions, components, and workflows.


== System Architecture

=== Frontend Architecture

[cols="1,4", options="header"]
|===
|Component |Description
|Core Application |The main React application that serves as the entry point and handles routing and global state management
|Component Hierarchy |Organized into Pages, Reusable Components, and UI Components
|State Management |Uses local component state with React hooks and shared state for checklist data
|Services |Includes File Storage Service for loading/saving checklists
|===


=== Data Flow

[arabic]
. User interactions trigger component-level events
. Events may update local state or propagate to parent components
. Changes to checklist data are stored in the shared state
. Persistence operations (save/load) are handled by the File Storage Service

        note right: File saved in JSON format
      case (Export checklist)
        :Export to desired format;

== Key Components

[.lead]
The application consists of several key components that provide its core functionality.

=== Home Page

[.card]
--
* Entry point for the application
* Provides navigation to create new checklists or load existing ones
--

=== Checklist Editor

[.card]
--
* Core functionality for creating and editing checklists
* Implements drag-and-drop interface for organizing checklist items
* Manages checklist state including items, descriptions, and metadata
--

=== Load Checklist

[.card]
--
* Interfaces with file system to load existing checklists
* Validates checklist data before loading into the editor
--

=== Checklist Types

[.card]
--
* Defines TypeScript interfaces for checklist data structure
* Ensures type safety across the application
--

    endswitch
  repeat while (Continue editing?) is (yes)
  ->no;
}

if (Return to home?) then (yes)
  :Navigate back to Home Page;
  goto start
else (no)
  :Exit application;
  stop
endif

[NOTE]
====
The user flow begins at the Home Page and allows users to either create a new checklist or load an existing one. After editing in the Checklist Editor, users can return home or exit the application.
====

== Deployment Architecture

[.lead]
The application is built as a client-side application that can be deployed to any static web hosting service.

The build process creates optimized static assets that can be served from CDNs for optimal performance.

== Security Considerations

[.card]
--
* Client-side validation ensures checklist data integrity
* No sensitive data is stored or processed within the application
--

== Future Enhancements

[.lead]
Potential areas for architectural expansion include:

[%step]
. Adding a backend API for cloud storage of checklists
. Implementing user authentication
. Adding collaborative editing features
. Supporting export to various formats (PDF, Excel, etc.)
